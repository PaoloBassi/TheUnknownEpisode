This is an Android application for the Design and Implementation of Mobile Application (DIMA) course
at Politecnico di Milano, Italy, held by Luciano Baresi.

This application should provide to the users a way to plan their free time, according to some data that the user
will provide (time spent at work, with family, hobbies, duties, little tasks and so on).
The purpose of the application is to understand and display the best solution according to some restrictions, and
if possible, try to suggest a way to find free time in order to be able to do some task on the Todo List.
